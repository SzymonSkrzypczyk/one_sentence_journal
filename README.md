# one_sentence_journal
A result of a quick idea and need for some vibe coding during one particular evening in Hong Kong ;D

# Reasons behind the idea
So basically one evening while going to sleep in my worringly hot room at dorm in Hong Kong I thought that I get a lot of cool ideas that I could write down, but never do. They are usually quick and could be described with one precise sentence - something that I'd like to master - more precisely being able to concisely express my ideas(I'm really REALLY talkative, so that could really do the trick for me ;)). Too spice things up I thought that an experiment of not adding any line to the code could spice things up a bit - pure vibe coding, just to prove how terrible the code turns out in the end ;D. So here are the results...


## Sidenote
